# MeteorologicalStation
A project made in VHDL to learn how to use it and how to program a FPGA.
The objective of this project was to make an easy to use and to maintain a meteorological station.
I choose to use the I2C protocol because I learn that it was used on the majority on the FPGA projects.
The web pages that shows the data is made in arduino and use an esp32.
